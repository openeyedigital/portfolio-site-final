Nacci Website Application (V1.0)

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
                    NACCI
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


How To Understand and Interact With This Site (P1 NOTES):
    01. Home.html (Will become the static "Coming Soon" page on the domain, the navigation bar has been intentionally limited to "Bookings" link)
    02. Bio.html (Acting as the 'home page' for the P1 project)
        - This will be a nested/navigable page on the official website (non P1)
    03. Bookings.html (A contact form is hosted here)
    04. The bottom footer "Made by: Open Eye Digital" is a nod to my company. Just wanted to add it. 




Site Objective: 
    01. Post music project ("Nacci") content onto a website in a tasteful and artsy way. 
    02. Create a (mostly responsive) visually pleasing atmosphere 
    03. Finish V1.0 and turn in as "Project: Portfolio Site (P1)"
